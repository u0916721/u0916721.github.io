Mike Leavitt announced last week thatpart of Utah's health-reform plan \u2014 thepart that expands Medicaid to the working poor \u2014 is being postponed. But why postpone something that was not expected to happenthis year anyway? Expansion of Medicaid. government health insurancefor thepoor, is an important part of Utah health reform. known as HealthPrint. From the outset that expansion was to phasein over sev eral years, depending on savings within the program andavailability of federal assistance. Last year, legislators extended cov erage to children 12 and older. This year,if legislators approve, low-income Utahns whoare aged, disabled or blind will join Medicaid rolls. HealthPrint would have added 56.000 other Utahns mostly the working poor, to the programlittle bylittle beginning in 1996 There\u2019s no need toalter that plan yet. The third phase was scheduled for legislative consideration next year, not this. It also hinged on Utah\u2019s ability to obtain a waiver of federal eligibility\u2019 rules. By next January. Utahns should know whatCongress will do about Medieaid, so they have plenty of timeto adjust local plans accordingly But now Gov. Leavitt has tossed cold water on HealthPrint by prompting doubt about his commitment to the workingpoor. If his administration isn't committed. why go through the laborious waiver process? Andif he is com- mitted. why not pressure Congress, as aninfluential Republican governor, to enable states to insure low-income residents? Thegovernor is quickto claim credit for leading the nation in health-care reform, and in someways, HealthPrint is aheadof other states\u2019 reforms.

This state is unusual in requiring insurers to cover unmarried dependents up to age 26. Its small-group insurance pools are open to individuals and to groups with as many as 50 members But some states have made greater strides in health reform than Utah Some have federal waivers to experi- Ne ers have moved closer to universal coverage. And now it is divulged that Utah's plan woulddrop 70,000 low-income people from dental, vision and hearing coverage as a way to expand general Medicaid benefits for low-inIf Gov. Leavitt truly wants to be a national leader in health-care reform, he will stand behind the working poor and persuade Congress to give states the tools they need to improve Medicaid Preserving American Dream Rainer Huck\u2019s letter (Forum, Dec. 18) deserves a circumspect response. nomic systems compatible with our own. The world is shrinking through communi- cations technology and cheapair fares. The UnitedStates has active friendships with countries that only a few years ago were adversaries. The great advances in trade \u2014 GATT, NAFTA and, for Europe- ans, the EU \u2014 have brought economic life along behind technology's advance, but opportunity for all that was unimaginable earlier. Yet the United States is unable to impose order on the world. Problems and conflicts long attributed to the Cold War have outlived it. New explanations for them mustbe sought The Soviet Union crippled itself through overspending on the military But the United States, too, overspent its to resources and is too deficit-ridden wield the real power it formerly exer- ing his mother on a personalized tour of the White House Mr. Clinton weighed in with more patience and added humor at a meeting with new congressionalleadersbytelling a reporter that \u201cMr. Gingrich will whisper into your right ear, and I will whisper into your left ear.\u201d He told Gingrich that \u201cGod knows\u201d what Chung could have gotten his mother \u2014 thelate Virginia Kelly \u2014 to say And heaven knows why mousetrapping people into making such statementsis even necessary. dominate andcontrol all living things and their habitat. He alleged that the rejection of Democrat candidates is a rejection of the \u201cenvironmental juggernaut which robs society of his version of the American Dream. In discussing this juggernaut, Huck asks whether we need to spend millions reaucrats to enforce environmental legis- lation. The American Dream lives in the turtles, in the owls, in the fish, in the trees and in the desert cryptogam that we sometimes trudge over heavy-footed, wiping away hundredsof yearsof organic development. Alltheseliving phenomena contribute to our well-being. If we cannot protect what we were born with, then the American Dream will die. Wedonot t instead of these creatures, nor do we exist fo conquer them; we exist with them All creatures and plantlife are meant habitat. Violation of the natural habitat has always resulted in vegetation depletion, predator and prey inequality, and other failings such as destruction of potentially beneficial drugs and increased Jerry O'Brien ( 1983-1994) fires and floods. Further, the fundamental imbalance occurs because the creatures and plarits do not ask for as much as humansdo. Only at the urging of persons cised, economic muscle. We must live with reduced influence instead. That leaves the problem of national- seeking to protect this dream can the mi- isms, newly freed from shackles, in collision. It leaves rogue regimes whose only hope for foreign exchangeis in sales of alone, without laws, will not do so illicit weaponry to other rogue regimes benton aggressionor intimidation It leaves societies breaking down from the evil of enemies within, whether in Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti or Cambodia. It leaves social breakdown, in Russia or Nigeria, a threat ultimately to us. None of these problemsequals the threat that Soviet hegemonyand power and subversion posed. None of the adversaries com- mands anything like the destructive pow- er that Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev did. But we lack a doctrine that makes clear when to intervene and whento turn nuscule needs of these plants and animals be addressed; and yes, by the lawmakers. We have shown that society Logic dictates that we protect these are inexorably entwined with theirs Also, if we judge another form oflife to be unimportant. we are rendered unimportant. In reality, our American Dream dies a bit each time we lose another species, each time we lose an old-growth tree and each time we lose a piece of wetland. We lose a piece of ourselves, for our contin- ued existenceis synchronouswith thelife that Huck would destroy. Preserving the environment and our constitutional rights is not mutually exclusive.

One of these facts is that it is virtually impossible in the modern world for an unmarried 14- or 15-year-old girl to work and be a mother. Everyone's interests (including the pregnant teen-ager) would be far better served if there was far more pressure. even some coercion. on these girls to place their babies for adoption Thesad fact is that thereareliterally thousands of married couples who are employed and who can provide for chil- dren but who are unableto have children These people are more than capableof providing warm and loving homes.

Andtoy guns should never be pointed at people. lessons To do so teaches bad Most of us who grew up hunting and took safety courses know the basics Always treat a gun as if it is loaded. Never point a gun at anything you don't plan to de stroy. Never travel with a loaded gun. Keep guns locked in one part of the house, ammunition locked in another. Always keep a gun unloaded until just before shooting. Keep your finger outside the trigger guard until your sights are aligned on the target and you are ready to fire the gun But many do not. The in- creasing numbers of homicides, gang-related shootings and homeaccidents mean that knowing the basic rules and something about guns might save a child's life The improper use of guns also concerns law-abiding gun owners who enjoy shooting at the range or who use their firearms to hunt.

Kevin Johnson, Mark Jackson, Tim Hardaway \u2014 maybehalf the league \u2014 rise out ofthe inner city to make a name andbetter life for themselves and their families Hoop Dreams,\u201d a documentary that opens Friday at Salt Lake\u2019s Tower Theatre, is a story about two of those city kids whose aspirations for basketbail glory are at the center of their existence.

Cold. warm, cruel hopeful Next time you watch a game on ESPN. it will make you wonder what each player has overcome. from where he or she has emerged. who helped them on their way, where they may go howthey sustained their hope. how muchBS they've endured It reaches far beyond slam dunks and facial jumpshots, clearly through ethnic stereotypes and athletic exploi- tation The film. directed by Steve James. who played basketball for Mike Fra- tello at James Madison University. focuseson thelives of William Gates and Arthur Agee, Chicago teen-agers with a dream \u2014 aswell as full-court pressures stemming from academics, lack of money, familylife, competition and, at times, desperation. James and producers Frederick Marx and Peter Gilbert rolled up 250 hoursoffilm, trailing the boys. their friends and families over a five-year period at home, school, games. practices, operating rooms, Nike camp. a Dick Vitale motivational speech (one of the film\u2019s low points) and college recruiting sessions From the netless rims of cement playgrounds to the glass boards of a prestigious private school and back viewers are introduced to the people embracing the boys\u2019 dreams and dreams of their own: Sheila Agee. Arthur\u2019s mother, who fights to keep her family together and economically afloat: Curtis Gates, William's older brother, whose NBA ambitions never crossed midcourt and who now lives vicariously through his brother's triumphs: Gene Pingatore, the clueless basketball coach at St. Joseph High School, neversatisfied with Gates, always measuring his accomplishments against those of a former pupil. Isiah Thomas. Pingatore. it is worth noting. has sued the filmmakersfor his less-thanglowing characterization in \u201cDreams 2 Let him sue. That is the beauty of the film. Reality always ticks people off, and this is nearly three hours of hard truth. The film shows the incongruities of the system; how schools evenatthe preplevel, give athletes an opportunityfor education. but also use them for their own purposes. But it transcendsthatstuff. It gives a glimpse of whatit\u2019s like to stretch for. moan and groan through. get sick and tired of, then rediscover the pursuit of an improbable dream.

We have had speakers from both sides come and speakto us. \u201cCould you try to help us decide whether having the Olympics in our state would be good or bad? \u201cIf you have had the Olympics where you live, did you like the effect it had and wouldyou like to have them again? \u201cDid the Olympicscost the tax- From Germany: Back in 1979, when I was born, Kiel hosted parts of the Olympics.

It created a very strong pride among the people. Long before the Olympics were hosted there were, as in Utah, many opinions about the issue, but when the Olympics came everyone got caught upin the spirit. Sure, moneyis a very important factor in all this, but don\u2019t ignore the human factor. Thatcher and Sherry Mckee Olympus Junior High From South Africa: Your problem is also one which concerns my city. Our politicians want the 2004 Olympic Games. They think thatit will have wonderful benefits and the ability to make profit. In myopinionit will only make a profit if run by businesspeople such as the person whoorganized Cremation: From Canada: There is absolutely no way that Calgary lost a billion dollars during our Olympies. It is my memory that our Olympics was definitely a money maker whenall was said and done. Most facilities are used again andagain. For examplethis weekend there will be two world cup luge races held here in Calgary. Lastyear there were two National Cup races. Next year we are holding the Jr. World Championships. Nakiska, where they held the alpine events, is now a very popular ski area. The Olympic oval in Calgary is one of the World'sfinest. The Olympics was one of the most magical things that have ever happened in mylife. The entire spirit that overwhelmed my city was absolutely amazing From Canada: I attended the recent Olympics in Norway. I think such Games are much more pleasant for the athletes and jour- nalists and spectators than for the inhabitants of the host town. My advice to you would be to acquire a real-world understanding of economics before hosting the Games. Takeall estimates with a pound of salt. Ask who will profit, ask whowill buy bonds,ask who will be taxed to pay the bondholders. Askhowfutureinterestrates will affect the profits, ask what jobs will be created and for howlong. Ask how many jobs would be created if the city\u2019s money were invested in long-term job creation. You should also measure money profits/loses next to such things as: promotion of future tourism, hosting a big party for visitors from around the world, possible environmental damage, and \u2014 the mostdifficult of all to measure \u2014 nourishment of the spirit. My personal view is that the Games(in spite of everything) do address something admirable. But for economic and environmentalreasons,it would bebetter to have a few moreor less perma- nent sites around the world \u2014 perhapsoneor two on each continent. From Canada: The Olympics are always advantageous on the whole. The Calgary Olympic Games were definitely successful, and now Canada has several world class facilities (bobsled. luge track, ski-jumping hill, skating oval, hockey rink, etc.) where our athletes can train. The Games also helped to establish an Olympic Endowment Fund, where the money is used purely for the athletes and the development of sport. The Montreal Games of 76 were unsuccessful primarily because politicians ran the organizing committee and they spent moneythey didn't have. From Canada: I remember fondly the thrill of having the Olympics hosted by our country but there wasthe cost. Fortunately, Alberta was a very wealthy province at the time and could afford the cost but Montrealis still affected to some degree The stadium was incomplete for the Olympics and has never been finished. From New York:Ourstate did indeed lose money and the place of the Games is now only occasionally used for recreational purposes. I would strongly urge you to think out the events. The environmentwill be hurt no matter what anyone says. They have to build. and they have to bring all those people there. Just hauling the garbage out will be a problem. Theonly reason for having the Games is for the publicity. From Atlanta: Here in Atlanta things are going great, and I think it will be very profitable for our state. Hosting the Olympics is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. If it is planned well then I would think that a place would not have anytrouble payingfor it. I would like to see Utah get the Gamesin 2002 I know I would be right there for them. Economical, Thoughtful Way to Go don't get any there. Utah is a bet- ter place to live. I cross-country ski, and the snow andtrails are greathere for that.I go out in the snow,but still don\u2019t likeit.\u201d Linton Green John VanWagenen Salt Lake City \u201cYes, probably because it\u2019s so dry andit\u2019s an easier powder to ski in. I've only skied on Utah snow \u2014 only go to warm places for winter vacations.\u2019 Peggy Bernal Salt Lake City By Richard Clark Salt Lake City Recently I read an article from Gannett News Service written by Mary Grace Gallaghertitled \u201cThe Business of Dying.\u201d Herarticle discussed changes in final disposition practices,stating that the highcostof traditional funeral and burial continues to moveit out of reach of more and more consumers, causing them to } \u201cI guess it depends on what you are talking about. For skiing, sure it\u2019s the greatest snow on earth. I've skied a lot of places \u2014 here it\u2019s a lighter, deeper snow with a better solid base. I grew up in Colorado andI've skied in Idaho and Washington. There's just j not as good of snow anywhere outside Utah.\u201d Doug Cipriano Sandpoint,Ida. Peggy Bernal \u201cSure. I haven't been to that manyother places in the winter, so as far as I know, yes Utah has the greatest snow onearth.\u201d Sue Smith Salt Lake City \u201cI don't know.

It\u2019sstill the same market-driven business that's out to make as many bucks as possible on our demise. The industry hasn't changed, but people have! That is what a preference for cremation is all about. If the writer had called the public being served, the article would have surely taken on a different tenor. Gallagher would have found out that a sizeable minority of the American public consider traditional practices to be antithetical to their viewpoint of what their needsare and and whatthe needs of the survivors are. For them,funeral parlors and cemeteries have no relevance. The final disposition process generally begins with the death of someone in the wee hours of the morning in a hospital somewhere, with grieving survivors realizing that they must now determine what happensto the body. At their most vulnerable moments they are inductad into a bers of yearly deaths cremated each year. Thereis no denying thatcostis a major determinant. but there are many other factors as well that have led to what is now a ma\u2018individual choice\u201d move- ment toward cremation. The reasons most often given are that cremationis: \u00a9 Practical and sensible, nothing superfluous; @ Rational, responsible and ethical, driven by thoughtful consideration for survivors\u2019 needs; @Simple and economical, dispenses with undue pageantry and doesn\u2019t impoverish survivors; \u00a9 Doesn't waste natural resources unnecessarily; \u00a9 Dignified without invasive practice of embalming; @ Allows beneficial return of bodily remains to biological sys- tems of the Earth, completing a circle of life of the body; @ Ecologically sound. Nourishes the Earth instead of fouling it with the deadly poison formaldehyde. These are not mere knee-jerk reasonings to rising prices. It\u2019s not a \u201choney, I think we should go the less expensive route\u201d decision. It is in fact a thoughtful, moving way from thedeleterious aspects of embalmed burial and all of its accouterments, born out of empathetic consideration for survivors\u2019 needs and for the Earth andits resources. The movement toward cremation is a movementto reclaim the most personal of things & our remains to a place. Fourthis the need for survivorsto grieve themselves to renewal. Burial has its own set of ceremonies that are prescribed that leave most everything to be car- ried out by the funeral home and the clergy of choice. Funerals and burials are generally religiously oriented, with more attention given to dogma than to the individual deceased. They are formally designed with prepared agendadelivered by se- ence on those present, creating bonds of connection that formal ceremonies cannotmatch. The growing popularity of cre- mation is a move toward shaping practices that are consistent with the values of the people. If the symbols of any society are a re- flection ofits values, we must ask whose values are served by the enormous cost and commodities of the trade.

I\u2019m from Texas and we the Los Angeles Games. One reason for having the Winter From South Africa: Your problem is also one which concerns my city. Our politicians want the 2004 From Japan: Why do you have to make such an elaborate \u201cHollywood\u201d production out of hosting the Olympics? You don't have to make Jules Verne type buildings that no one will visit after the Olympics. Think about making buildings that can be dissembled after the Games for other uses like housing. Recycle the park after the Games. From Norway: WhenLillehammer hosted the Games this was the biggest event ever to happen in ourlittle country. It created a very strong pride among the people. Long before the Olympics were hosted there were, as in Utah, many opinions about the issue, but when the Olympics came everyone got caughtup in thespirit. Sure, moneyis a very important factorin all this, but don\u2019t ignore the humanfactor. From Canada: There is absolutely no way that Calgary lost a billion dollars during our Olympics. It is my memory that our Olympics was definitely a money maker whenall was said and done. Mostfacilities are used again and again. For examplethis weekend there will be two world cup luge races held here in Calgary. Lastyear there were two National World Championships. Na- events, is now a very popular ski area.

I think such Games are much more pleasant for the athletes and journalists and spectators than for the inhabitantsof the host town. My advice to you would be to acquire a real-world understanding of economics before hosting the Games. Take all estimates with a pound of salt. Ask who will profit, ask whowill buy bonds, ask whowill be taxed to pay the bondholders. Ask how futureinterest rates will affect the profits, ask what jobs will be created and for howlong. Ask how many jobs would be created if the city\u2019s money were invested in long-term job creation. You should also measure money profits/loses next to such things as: promotion of future tourism, hosting a big party for visitors from around the world, possible environmental damage, and \u2014 the mostdifficult of all to measure \u2014 nourishment of the spirit. My personal view is that the Games(in spite of everything) do address something admirable. But for economic and environmentalreasons,it would be better to have a few moreorless permanent sites around the world \u2014 perhapsone or two on each continent. From Canada: The Olympics are always advantageous on the whole. The Calgary Olympic Games were definitely successful, and velopment of sport. The Montreal Games of \u201876 ing committee and they spent moneytheydidn\u2019t have. From Canada: I remember fondly the thrill of having the Olympics hosted by our country. but there wasthecost. Fortunately, Alberta wasa very wealthy province at the time and could afford the cost but Montrealis still affected to some degree The stadium was incomplete for the Olympics and has never been finished From New York: Ourstate did indeed lose moneyand the place of the Games is now only occasionally used for recreational purposes. I would strongly urge you to think out the events. The environmentwill be hurt no matter what anyone says. They have to build, and they have to bring all those people there. Just hauling the garbage out will be a problem. The only reason for having the Gamesis for the publicity From Atlanta: Here in Atlanta things are going great, and I think it will be very profitable for our state. Hosting the Olympicsis a once-in-a-lifetime experience. If it is planned well then I would think that a place would not have anytrouble payingfor it. I would like to see Utah get the Games in 2002 I know I would be right there for them. Economical, Thoughtful Wayto Go don\u2019t get any there. Utahis a better placeto live. I cross-country ski, and the snow andtrails are great hereforthat. I go out in the snow, but I still don\u2019t like it.\u201d Linton Green Salt Lake City John VanWagenen \u201cYes, probably becauseit\u2019s so dry andit\u2019s an easier powderto ski in. I\u2019ve only skied on Utah snow \u2014I only go to warm places for winter vacations. Peggy Bernal Salt Lake City \u201cI guess it depends on what you are talking about. For skiing, sure it\u2019s the greatest snow on earth.I\u2019ve skied a lot of places \u2014 hereit\u2019s a lighter, deeper snow with a better solid base. I grew up in Colorado andI've skied in Idaho and Washington. There's just not as good of snow anywhere outside Utah.\u201d Doug Cipriano Sandpoint,Ida. \u201cSure. I haven't been to that many other places in the winter, so as far as I know, yes Utah has Peggy Bernal the greatest snow onearth.\u201d Sue Smith Salt Lake City \u201cI don't know. It\u2019s just good snow for skiing, I guess. It's light and has low water content. I like to ski here in Utah. I've skied in Idaho and California. The snow hereisdifferent than in California \u2014 it\u2019s lighter, andit\u2019s also usually lighter than the snow in Idaho. There is great powder in Utah, and there is a lot of snow here even though we've been in a drought.\u201d Kevin Marcoux Salt Lake City \u201cI hate the snow. I don't ski Saying Utah has the greatest snow on earthis really just a ski statement. Snow is just snow whenyou don't ski.\u201d Maureen Russell Salt Lake City \u201cI've never been anywhere else, so I would assume Utah does have the greatest snow.

I\u2019m not muchofa winter person.\u201d Stephanie Branch Salt Lake City \u00a7 * Po By Richard Clark Salt Lake City Recently I read an article from Gannett NewsService written by Mary Grace Gallaghertitled \u201cThe Business of Dying.\u201d Herarticle discussed changes in final disposition practices, stating that the high costof traditional funeral andburial continues to moveit out of reach of more and more consumers, causing them to turn to lower priced alternatives. Like many other articles writ- ten about the funeral and burial industry over the past two decades, this article focused on cost and assesses industry changes based primarily in economics. Yet it seems minimalist at best to consider that cost alonedrivesus. This journalist apparently called around to funeral homes and cremation societies to find out what makes the industry tick. The quotes from the funeral di- rectors don\u2019t seem to change, deerying low-cost competitors as crass and undignified, creating an erosion of tradition, and a corresponding erosion of or. \u2018its. \u201cThey (funeral homes) arein it to make money. Just like any oth- er businessis in it to make money,\u201d sated one funeral director, which sumsupthe industry position in a nutshell. No, it hasn't changed. It\u2019s still the same market-driven business that\u2019s out to make as many bucks as possible on our demise. The industry hasn't changed, but people have! That is what a preference for cremation is all about. If the writer had called the public being served, the article would have surely taken on a different tenor. Gallagher would have found out that a sizeable minority of the American public consider traditional practices to be antithetical to their viewpoint of what their needs are and and what the needs of the survivors are. For them,funeralparlors and cemeteries have no relevance. The final disposition process generally begins with the death of someonein the wee hours of the morningin a hospital somewhere, with grieving survivors realizing that they must now determine what happensto the body. le moAt their most vulne: into a ments they are induct system in which theyfeellittle control, andin which state laws \u2014 bodies \u2014 from an industry that has clearly shownits ineptitude they are told \u2014 require they do something immediately for thoughtful change, promoting practices that by their very nature Thereis no educational process in the system of funeral and burial in our country.

People\u2019s values are changing, and the change supports crema- tion far deeper into the population than is expressed by the numbers of yearly deaths cremated each year. Thereis no denying that costis a major determinant, but there are many other factors as well that have led to whatis now a major \u201cindividual choice\u201d movement toward cremation. The reasons most often given are that cremationis: @ Practical and sensible, nothing superfluous; @ Rational, responsible and ethical, driven by thoughtful consideration for survivors\u2019 needs; @Simple and economical, dispenses with undue pageantry and doesn\u2019t impoverish survivors; @ Doesn't waste natural resources unnecessarily; \u00a9 Dignified without invasive practice of embalming; @ Allows return of bodily remains to biological systems of the Earth, completing a circle oflife of the body; \u00a9 Ecologically sound.

Fourth is the needfor survivorsto grieve themselves to renewal. Burial has its own set of ceremonies that are prescribed that leave most everything to be carried out by the funeral home and the clergy of choice. Funerals and burials are generally religiously oriented, with more attention given to dogma than to the individual deceased. They are formally designed with prepared agenda delivered by se- becauseit is a departure from familiar practices. Memorialtributes are generally hosted by family and friends.

Our politicians want the 2004 Olympic Games.They think thatit will have wonderful benefits and the ability to make a profit. In myopinionit will only make a profit if run by businesspeople such as the person who organized From Japan: Why do you have to makesuch anelaborate Hollywood\u201d production out of hosting the Olympics? You don\u2019t have to make Jules Verne type buildings that no one will visit after the Olympics. Think about making buildings that can be dissembled after the Gamesfor other uses like housing. Recycle the park after the Games. From Norway: WhenLillehammer hosted the Games this was the biggest event ever to happen in our little country. It created a very strong pride among the people. Long before the Olympics were hosted there were, as in Utah, many opinions about the issue, but when the Olympics came everyone got caught up in the spirit Sure, moneyis a very important factorin all this, but don\u2019t ignore the humanfactor. From Canada: There is absolutely no way that Calgary lost a billion dollars during our Olympics. It is my memory that our Olympics wasdefinitely a money maker whenall was said and done. Most facilities are used again andagain. For examplethis weekend there will be two world cup luge races held here in Calgary.

I think such Games are much more pleasant for the athletes and jour- now Canada has several worldclass facilities (bobsled. luge track, ski-jumping hill, skating oval, hockey rink, ete.) where our athletes can train The Games also helped to es- tablish an Olympic Endowment Fund, where the money is used purely for the athletes and the developmentofsport The Montreal Games of \u201876 were unsuccessful primarily because politicians ran the organizing committee and they spent moneytheydidn\u2019t have From Canada: [| remember nalists and spectatorsthan for the inhabitants of the host town My advice to you would be to fondly the thrill of haying the Olympics hosted by our country. acquire a real-world understanding of economics before hosting Fortunately, Alberta was a very wealthy province at\u2019the time and the Games Takeall estimates with a pound of salt. Ask who will profit, ask who will buy bonds, ask who will be taxed to pay the bondholders. Ask howfuture interest rates will affect the profits, ask what jobs will be created and for how long. Ask how many jobs would be created if the city\u2019s money were invested in long-term job creation. You should also measure money profits/loses next to such things as: promotion of future tourism, hosting a big party for visitors from around the world, possible environmental damage, and \u2014 the mostdifficult of all to measure \u2014 nourishment of the spirit. My personal viewis that the Games(in spite of everything) do address something admirable. But for economic and environmentalreasons, it would be better to have a few moreorless permanent sites around the world \u2014 perhapsone or two on eachcontinent From Canada: The Olympics are always advantageous on the whole. The Calgary Olympic Games were definitely successful, and but there was the cost. could afford the cost but Montrealis still affected to some degree The stadium was incomplete for the Olympics and has never been finished. From New York: Ourstate did indeed lose money and theplace of the Games is now only occasionally used for recreational purposes. I would strongly urge you to think out the events. The environmentwill be hurt no matter what anyonesays. Theyhave to build. and they have to bring all these people there Just hauling the garbage out will be a problem. The onlyreason for having the Gamesis for the publicity. J From Atlanta: Here in Atlanta things are goinggreat, and I think it will be very profitable for or state. Hosting the Olympics is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. \u00ab If it is planned well then: I would think that a place would not have any trouble payingfort.

This journalist apparently called around to funeral homes and cremation societies to find out what makesthe industrytick. The quotes from the funeral directors don\u2019t seem to change, deerying low-cost competitors as crass and undignified, creating an erosion of tradition, and a correspondingerosionof profits. \u201cThey (funeral homes)are in it to make money. Just like any oth- er business is in it to make money,\u201d sated one funeral director, which sumsup the industry position in a nutshell. No, it hasn't changed.It\u2019sstill the same market-driven business that\u2019s out to make as many bucks as possible on our demise. The industry hasn't changed, but people have! That is what a preference for cremation is all about. public would ferent If the writer had called the being served, the article have surely taken ona diftenor Gallagher would have found out that a sizeable minority of the American public consider traditional practices to be antithetical to their viewpoint of what their needsare and and whatthe needs of the survivors are. For them,funeral parlors and cemeteries have no relevance The final disposition process generally begins with the death of someonein the wee hoursof the morningin a hospital somewhere, with grieving survivors realizing that they must now determine what happensto the body. At their most vulnerable moments they are inducted into a system in which they feellittle control, and in which state laws \u2014 they are told \u2014 require they do something immediately. Thereis no educational process in the system of funeralandburial in our country. The only information given is offered when survivors are \u201cat need.\" This means someonehas died, and they, the survivors, must makeall the decisions for the final disposition of that body at a time when they would least like to. But in the absence of a plan. they are com- pelled. People's values are changing, and the change supports cremation far deeper into the population than is expressed by the numbers of yearly deaths cremated each year. Thereis no denyingthatcostis a major determinant, but there are many other factors as well that have led to what is now a major \u201cindividual choice\u201d movement toward cremation. The reasons most often given are that cremationis: @ Practical and sensible, nothing superfluous; \u00a9 Rational, responsible and eth- ical, driven by thoughtful consideration for survivors\u2019 needs; @Simple and economical, dispenses with undue pageantry and doesn't impoverish survivors; @Doesn\u2019t waste natural resources unnecessarily; \u00a9 Dignified without invasive practice of embalming; @ Allows beneficial return of bodily remains to biological systems of the Earth, completing a circle of life of the body; \u00a9 Ecologically sound. Nourish- es the Earth instead of fouling it with the deadly poison formaldehyde. These are not mere knee-jerk reasonings to rising prices. It\u2019s not a \u201choney, I think we should go the less expensive route\u2019 decision. It is in fact a thoughtful, moving way from thedeleterious aspects of embalmed burial and all of its accouterments, born out of empathetic consideration for survivors\u2019 needs and for the Earth andits resources. The movement toward cremation is a movement to reclafin the most personal of things \u2014 our bodies \u2014 from an industry that has clearly shown its ineptitude for thoughtful change, promoting practices that by their very nature misappropriate our needs. And what are our needs? Beyond the need and right of each individualte choose their preference for the final disposition of their own body. the needsareall survivors\u2019 Whether a body is buried or crematedall survivors have certain ritual needs in common, and if those needs are attendedto, it wili help them heal. First is the need to see the body. Secondis the need to pay tribute to the memory of the deceased Third is the need to ground the remains to a place. Fourth is the need for survivorsto grieve themselves to renewal. Burial has its own set of ceremonies that are prescribed that leave most everything to be carried out by the funeral home and the clergy of choice. Funerals and burials are generally religiously oriented, with more attention given to dogma than to the individual deceased. They are formally designed with prepared agenda delivered by se- lected speakers. Generally, all the family has to do is sit back and listen and pay the bill Cremation, on the other-hand, has no routineset of prescriptions becauseit is a departure from familiar practices. Memorial tributes are generally hosted by family and friends. They are less ceremonial and formal and muchless fixed, allowing general participation of family and friends that share their de\u00e9ply felt stories of experience and connection with the deceased Ofthosetributes I have attended, all who wish to say something are encouragedto doso. This kind of participatorysetting is a valuable supportinfluence on those present, creating bondsof connection that formal ceremonies cannot match.

Like many other articles written about the funeral and burial industry over the past two decades, this article focused on cost and assesses industry changes basedprimarily in economics. Yet it seems minimalist at best to consider that cost alone drives us. This journalist apparently called around to funeral homes and cremation societies to find out what makesthe industry tick. The quotes from the funeral directors don\u2019t seem to change, de- were, as in Utah, many opinions From Canada: There is absolutely no way that Calgary lost a system in which they feel little control, andin whichstate laws \u2014 they are told \u2014 require they do something immediately. Thereis no educational process in the system of funeral and burial in our country. The only infor- mationgiven is offered whensurvivors are \u201c\u2018at need.\u201d This means someone has died, and they, the survivors, must makeall the decisions for the final disposition of that body at a time when they wouldleast like to. But in the absence of a plan, they are compelled. People\u2019s values are changing, and the change supports crema- tion far deeper into the population than is expressed by the numbers of yearly deaths cremated each year. Thereis no denying that cost is crass and undignified, creating an erosion oftradition, and a correspondingerosion ofprofits. \u201cThey (funeral homes)arein it ty make money. Justlike any oth- ing superfluous; crying low-cost competitors as er business is in it to make monty,\u201d sated one funeral director, which sumsuptheindustry position in a nutshell No,it hasn't changed. It\u2019sstill the same market-driven business that's out to make as many bucks as possible on our demise. The industry hasn\u2019t changed, but people have! That is what a preference for cremation is all about. If the writer had called the public being served, the article would have surely taken on a dif- ferent tenor. Gallagher would have found out thata sizeable minority of the American public consider traditional practices to be antithetical \u00a9 Rational, responsible and ethical, driven by thoughtful consideration for survivors\u2019 needs; @Simple and economical, dispenses with undue pageantry and doesn\u2019t impoverish survivors; \u00a9@Doesn\u2019t waste natural resources unnecessarily; \u00a9 Dignified without invasive practice of embalming; @ Allows beneficial return of bodily remains to biological systems of the Earth, completing a circleoflife of the body; \u00a9 Ecologically sound.

For them, funeral parlors and cemeteries have no relevance. These are not mere knee-jerk reasonings to rising prices.

The Olympics was one of the most magical things that have ever happenedin mylife. The entire spirit that overwhelmed my city was absolutely amazing. pleasant for the athletes and journalists and spectators than for the inhabitants of the host town. My advice to you would be to acquire a real-world understanding of economics before hosting the Games. Takeall estimates with a pound of salt. Ask who will profit, ask whowill buy bonds, ask whowill be taxed to pay the bondholders. Ask howfutureinterest rates will affect the profits, ask what jobs will be created and for howlong. Ask how many jobs would be created if the city\u2019s money were invested in long-term job creation. You should also measure monprofits/loses next to oval, hockey rink, ete.) where our athletes can train. The Gamesalso helped to establish an Olympic Endowment Fund, where the money is used purely for the athletes and the development of sport.

From Canada: I remember fondly the thrill of having the Olympics hosted by our country, but there wasthe cost. Fortunately, Alberta was a very wealthy province at the time and could afford the cost but Montreal is still affected to some degree. The stadium was incomplete for the Olympics and has never been finished. From New York:Ourstate did indeed lose money and the place of the Games is now only occasionally used for recreational purposes. I would strongly urge you to think out the events. The environmentwill be hurt no matter what anyonesays.

Butfor economic and environmentalreasons,it would be better to have a few moreorless perma- nent sites around the world \u2014 perhapsoneor two on eachcontinent. From Canada: The Olympics are always advantageous on the whole. The Calgary Olympic Games were definitely successful, and Just hauling the garbage out son for having the Gamesis for the publicity. From Atlanta: Here in Atlanta things are goinggreat, and I think it will be very profitable for our state. Hosting the Olympics is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. If it is planned well then I would think that a place would not have anytrouble payingforit I would like to see Utah get the Gamesin 2002. I know I would be right there for them. Economical, Thoughtful Wayto Go a major determinant, but there are many other factors as well that haveled to whatis now a major \u201cindividual choice\u201d movement toward cremation.

And what are our needs? Beyond the need andright of each individual to choose their preference for the final disposition of their own body, the needsare all survivors\u2019. Whether a body is buried or crematedall survivors have certain ritual needs in common, and if those needs are attendedto,it will help them heal. Firstis the need to see the body. Secondis the needto pay tribute to the memory of the deceased. Third is the need to ground the remains to a place. Fourthis the needfor survivorsto grieve themselves to renewal. Burial has its own set of ceremonies that are prescribed that leave most everything to be carried out by the funeral home and the clergy of choice. Funerals and burials are generally religiously oriented, with more attention given to dogma than to the individual deceased. They are formally designed with prepared agenda deliveredby se- lected speakers. Generally, all the family has to do is sit back and listen and paythe bill Cremation, on the other hand, hasnoroutineset of prescriptions becauseit is a departure from familiar practices. Memorialtributes are generally hosted by family and friends. They are less ceremonial andformaland muchlessfixed, allowing general participation of family andfriends that share their deeply felt stories of experience and connection with the deceased. Ofthose tributes I have attended, all who wish to say something are encouraged to do so. This kind of participatory setting is a valuable supportinfluence on those present, creating bonds of connection that formal ceremonies cannot match. The growing popularity of cremation is a move toward shaping practices that are consistent with the values of the people. If the symbols of any society are a reflectionof its values, we must ask whose values are served by the enormous cost and commodities of the trade.
