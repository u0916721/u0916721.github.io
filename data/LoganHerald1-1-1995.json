US District Judge Dee Benson has dismissed a suit by the Summum religion which wanted to place a monument with its maxima on tiie Salt Lake County courthouse lawn Summum a sect founded in Salt Lake in the 1970s argued that if Christianity\u2019s Tfcn Commandments can be displayed on a tablet its maxims should be allowed The church argued that the county commission violated its constitutional rights by favoring me set of religious beliefs over another But Benson cited a 1973 decision by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals that the Tbn Commandments are mainly secular not religious in nature \" the Commission has not established a public forum for religious views and Summum has no right of access to the courthouse lawn simply because it is owned or controlled by the government\u201d Benson wrote in his opinion issued Friday Brian Barnard attorney for the Summum religion said other courts of appeal have since ruled the Ten Commandments are religious \u201cThat opinion '(10th Circuit\u2019s) in

has kept secret thousands of pages of documents detailing arbitration between the Salt Lake Buzz and former Salt Lake Trappers baseball dubs US District Judge David Sam on Monday initially unsealed the documents then after an hour recess essentially reversed himself by ordering the documents withdrawn from court Because the documents which include a transcript of arbitration proceedings were under a confidentiality order stemming from the arbitration they will remain secret Attorneys for the Salt Lake Trappers filed the thousands of pages of transcripts and sworn testimony in response to Buzz owner Joe Buzas filing suit to overturn part of a $16 million damages award to the \"Dappers and the Pioneer League Baseball arbitrator George Nicolau ruled that Buzas had tampered with the

files contain information of \u201csubstantial public concern\u201d particularly concerning the conduct of Leonard who had arranged to buy the Buzz franchise while on the task force The deal fell

salt dome or was created when a big meteor struck millions of years ago The weeklong field phase of the three-ye- ar study should settle debate over whether the mound of rock is the remains of a meteorite impact crater Results will be known within a year after the data are analyzed said Jeff Plescia head of the $150000 study and manager of planetary geology and geophysics for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Earlier studies of shattered rocks and quartz crystals convinced many researchers that a meteor \u2014 either an asteroid or comet fragment \u2014 slammed into southeast Utah sometime between 5 million and 1-- to 100 million years ago They believe the top few hundred yards of the crater later erod- ed away exposing Upheaval Dome which they think is a central rebound peak created when the ground rebounded The study allows them to examine what may be the planet\u2019s most deeply eroded impact crater and the only one in a US national park \u201cIt gives us

(AP) \u2014 Roger Williams rays the' memory of his athletic neighbor\u2019s sudden and unexplained death more than three decades ago sustained his eventually successful quest to find an answer Williams was shocked to As a teen-agman a par golfer and learn the tennis enthusiast had collapsed without warning and died on die greens But there was a clue for the curious Williams: the man\u2019s

After years of research and schooling Williams eventually discovered his neighbor suffered from a disorder called familial or FH Wiliams a professor of Internal Medicine in the Cardiology Division at the University of Utah School of Medicine has since helped develop an elaborate tracking system to find others at risk So far he has located about 800 Utahns who have FH and he hopes to find more \u201cOnce we find these people we want to help them prevent early death\" he said \u201cto help people from falling through the cracks and contacting them periodically so they don\u2019t stop their

throughout the United States and 13 foreign countries choFH is characterized by lesterol levels that often are more than twice as high as normal A genetic defect makes it impossible for a person with FH to effectively process and eliminate cholesterol The first case of FH was described about 100 years ago Williams said although the genetic defect was not discovered until the 1960s or \u201970s Wiliams estimates that one in 500 people have FH but most don\u2019t realize it until it\u2019s too late The disorder typically causes heart attacks in men between the ages of 40 and 55 to Sec

members of their families \u2014 to participate in a study aimed at locating the diabetes gene or genes Participating families must have at least two siblings with the adult form (type II) diabetes In addition other family members must be willing to participate at some point in the study The adult form of diabetes (non or type II diabetes) afflicts more than one in every 20 Americans Members of insulin-depende- nt a family in which an immediate relative has diabetes have more than twice the risk of developing diabetes themselves Researchers expect the study will provide a better understanding of why some people get diabetes In addition they anticipate the development of treatments which may prevent diabetes in people with an inherited predisposition Pm more information about
