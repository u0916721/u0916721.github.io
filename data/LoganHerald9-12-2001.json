began piecing igether a case linking Osama in Laden to the worst terrorist attack in U'S history aided by an intercept of communications between his supporters and harrowing cell phone calls from

but several sources close to him \u2014 including his family members in Saudi Arabia \u2014 say bin Laden has regular access to satellite telephones and other sophisticated communication equipment Muttawakil said there is no fear among the Taliban \u201cSince there is no reason for an attack and we are not expecting any reprisal attack we are not taking any precautions\u201d he said Federal Jaw

kids\u201d Larsen said \u201cIt\u2019s only going to agitate them We pretty much went with our regular routine\u201d Superintendent of Preston School District Ted Taylor said watching news media was

were following the Salt Lake School District\u2019s idea of keeping TVs and radios off he said \u201cWe think it\u2019s pretty wise for young kids (to keep the TV off at school)\u201d Norton said \"They\u2019re better off at school than they would be at home where some wouldn\u2019t even have older siblings at home and they would have a steady diet of the news with no one to help intopret

Answer By: Leona K Hawks Utah State University Extension Housing Specialist Public drinking water in the United States is generally safe however it is wise to be aware that water can become contaminated Contaminants often have no pdor or color Bacteria and viruses may cause upset stomachs diarrhea or more serious illnesses Lead can enter water from corroded plumbing and can cause learning and behavioral problems as well as other illnesses Chemi- cals can wash off lawns and fields or leak from storage containers or gas and oil can seep into the ground water where even a small amount can cause cancer damage to kidneys liver or other organs or health risks to pregnant women Radon a naturally occurring radioactive gas found in some well water escapes into the air in the home from showers and washing machines and has been linked to lung cancer Nitrate gets into water from animal and human waste and from fertilizer Some experts believe nitrate can cause miscarriages in pregnant women birth defects and illness to some infants under six months old Though contaminants can be hard to detect there are things you can do to prevent them from harming your water Consider these suggestions If you think you have a water problem have your water tested Call the Department of Health for assistance in obtaining a water sample If you find your water\u2019s radon level is 10000 pico curies per liter or higher contact the Utah Department of Health or the Department of Environmental Quality for methods of aerating the water before it enters your house If you have pipes soldered with lead do not use hot water from the tap for cooking or drinking because heat can dissolve die metal If you must use die water and haven\u2019t used your tap for several hours clear out the pipes by letting cold water run until you feel die temperature change Very soft water which is more corrosive than hard water is especially likely to leach lead from soldered pipes or brass fixtures Prevent die backflow of contami nated water from entering your water supply by leaving an air gap between die yvater supply and any reservoir 6f dirty water rar example if you are filling a swimming pool with a hose leave an air gap between the hose and the water m the pool Ibilets and washing marJiiw have built-i-n air gaps Ifan air gap cannot be main- tained a backflow prevention
