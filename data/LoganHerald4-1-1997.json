Take a walk to raise AIDS awareness By Courtney Moser May 3 and 4 the Cache Valley AIDS Council will sponsor many activi- ties around the first AIDS Walk in walk will raise Logan The money to support the educational programs of the council and begin to fund two-mi- le the client support services that are needed by persons-an- d families living in the Cache Valley who have been impacted by HIV and AIDS Other activities including the display of a small portion of the NAMES Project AIDS Quii ded- ication of a new quilt panel and a Candlelight Vigil will help to put faces on the epidemic and hope into the fight agrinst it The Cache Valley AIDS Council was formed in 1987 to pro vide HIVAIDS education support and services to the people of Cache Valley affect- ed by the disease Hundreds of educational programs have been put on by the council in the last 10 years from Bancroft Idaho to Tremonton At the invitation of the individual teachers students are taught the basics of HIV prevention including the biology of the virus and transmission vectors Usually a person with AIDS is also a part of the program and they give their insight into the dis- ease how to live with it and how important it is to avoid it According to recent local statistics up to 38 of high school students will have engaged in sexual activity by the time they graduate from high school In some schools teen-ag- e pregnancies are epidemic Special programs must be paid for to keep teenage girls in school by providing day care to their children- Obviously the work of the council ta inform young people about the transmission of HIV is only one part of the sex 'education a young person needs The desperate need for open informed and frank discussion at home by parents is going to be the most important education you can give your children and the best way to encourage their safest participation in sexual activity whether or not they choose to wait for that forever mate education efforts All of our are aimed at providing the young people we encounter the tools to begin to ques- tion the decisions they either have already made or are about to make in regards to sexual activity Every effort is made to encourage the students to take their information and questions home to their parents One of our chief disap- pointments is that we already know that the great majority of students cannot talk to their parents about sex because the parents nave not talked to the child especially the boys about sex and probably won\u2019t More than 40 families in the Cache Valley have been directly affected by HIV and AIDS Many more have been touched by the disease through brothers sisters parents aunts and uncles cousins who live in other parts of Utah the United States and throughout the world We need to be a supportive community to those who feel this burden We need to be a community that opens hearts and spaces for people to talk through their anger frustration doubt and fear grief and loss We need to be a community that shares the resources that make a life worth living We need to be a community that says to our young people that we care for you and want your happiness to include long life safely and well lived and loved The NAMES Project AIDS Quilt is one of the ways that those persons who have died from complications of AIDS are not forgotten ana that even as they have gone on ahead they can remind us to talk to each other know rach other before we are genie The many beautiful and poignant tributes to the ordinary lives led by the thousands of persons immortalized through the Quilt panels make it easier for us to open up that lifesaving conversation Remember when we all That was so great when we all I Ryan White was so great because want to live my whole life so that I can The most touching memorials are children\u2019s teddy bears flowers the football jerseys the personal things that helped to say This was my loved one The colors The lettering The handwritten notes of love and loss There are many panels that are part of the quilt from Utah and Idaho and there will be at least one new panel presented to the quilt from a Logan family during the weekend Logan has held World AIDS Day (Dec 1) services for the past two years and candlelight vigil and mobilization observances the past two years as well This will be the first AIDS Walk io- the Vfclley loin with us arid walk fly your walking you will be saying to your children: Yes 1 am aware of AIDS I am aware of the dangers that you my precious children will face as you seek to find a lifelong and fulfilling mate And Yes I am available to talk to you I want to talk to you Because I want you to live As your children participate in the walk know that they are saying to you: I need this information I need to be able to process this information and be able to incorporate it into my living And we will all say to those who have been directly impacted by HIV and AIDS: We understand your grief and your fear Tfell me (us) about it What can we do?

The election campaigns ended This year we're back to crotchety old Spear crying d money \u2014 the 1040EZ \u2014 you had to wade through more than 30 pages instructions of It\u2019s such a pitiful abject stupid waste of resources Exactly how wasteful? Well an econofine-pri- nt mist named James Payne wrote a book called \u201cCostly Returns\u20191\u2019 a few years ago in which he estimated that the total national tab \u2014 including the expenses of record-keepin- g filing auditing attor- neys and accountants and the money lost through the disincentive of maiginal tax rates \u2014 at an astounding $393 billion per year What happened to the Great Tax Debate? Last year you couldn\u2019t read a paper or scan the spectrum without encountering a tax simplification scheme There was the ArmeyShelby flat-ta- x plan the Forbes flat-ta- x plan the Specter Buchanan Gephardt and Gramm flat-ta- x plans There was the Kemp Commission and talk of value- - in the wildemess Next year we\u2019ll have iriore elections arid the pols will need something to babble about and maybe we\u2019ll talk about flat taxes again I say it\u2019s time to cease this biennial yapping and do something Why not launch an experiment in which we gradsystem? If it ually shift to a flat-ta- x seems to be working and if the economy holds up during the transition we could try it for a few years and then make a final decision Personally I would favor a plan similar to those touted by Dick Armey and Steve Forbes They would allow large allowances for a family of four ($33300 for Armey $36800 tor Forbes) and then It would be fair Because of the sonal exemptions the poor would be protected Everyone else would be paywould ing the same rate The exemptions also render the system progressive: The more a person earns the greater the percentage of total income the person would pay \u2014 up to the 17 percent cap It would encourage savings and investment the income from which would not be taxed The economy as a resull might well explode with activity One Harvard economisl Dale Jorgenson predicts a $2 trillion increase in national wealth It would discourage corruption because the lack of loopholes would reduce the market in political favors Did you know there are nearly 13000 special interests represented by lobbyists in Washington bers of the DC? Did tax-writi- ng you know memHouse Ways and Means Committee receive the greatest percentage of their campaign contributions? Gee wonder why? It would stifle \u201csocial engineering\u201d by politicians who think they know better than we do where we should invest what we should purchase and how we should contribute The people who wanted our votes last year demagogued this issue to the point of nausea They said that home values would plummet and charities would suf- fer They said the middle class would tax wages salaries and pensions in ' pay more taxes and the rich less They said government revenues would plunge excess of that amount at 17 percent There would be no other deductions Businesses would pay 17 percent on income after expenses The advantages of such a system would be manifold: It would be so simple you could file on a postcard They said the stock market wouli tum-ble So 1 say let\u2019s test it Let\u2019s ease into it by degrees and see what happens My guess is we would love it so much that we would want to make it a capital crime to mess with it ties and recognition Tax blues?

I'll have someone else give the sermon upstairs and I'll go down to the children and share a message with them\u201d she said St John's offers more than just an occasional visit from the Reverend Each Sunday's worship begins with a procession which includes children The procession then takes them olf to a worship service of their own but then the youngsters receive a special invitation to attend the second half of the \u201cadult\" worship service \u201c1 think we grow in faith as we participate in the church sacramental life Con- sequently our children come back halfway through the service They're in their own worship service during the sermon prayers and lessons which tend to be more cognitive and intellectual and then they come back when there's more movement when they can take Holy Communion with all the adults\u201d Breck-enridexplained For its part the LDS Church tries to teach enjoyablt worship through its Primary program said Logan 3rd Ward Bishop Brent Bryner With at least 63 creative little minds to occupy each Sunday Bryner and other 3rd Ward members have quite a job \u201cWe actually start classes for our children at 18 months Primary goes until they\u2019re 12 From 18 months to 3 years old they attend what we call the nursery Even in the nursery we have simple lessons and sing simple songs to try to help prepare and train the children\u201d Bryner said But when it comes to attending the weekly Sacrament Meeting parents are on their own And while what they leam in Primary can help children enjoy the formal worship service kids being kids leave moms and dads with little choice than to have a few tricks up their sleeve Lori Lundberg a member of the 3rd Ward explained: \u201cNow I'm probably the but last person to be talking about this my philosophy is that I want my children to think the chapel is the best place to be So while we\u2019re in there I\u2019ll let my kids have a small toy or Checrios or play little games on paper When they start to act up I
