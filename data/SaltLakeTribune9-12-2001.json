In the latter case, ofcourse, the 40 The Olympic Games, aneived asacatalyst for international friendship through Hae cits coleciat with a stato otwar. but six decades ago some of its idealists still dreamed thatit could. The International 0 ic Committee supported holding the 1940 until the host countries themselves bailed out and turned their attentions to war, not peace. The 1940 Olympic Games had been awarded to Japan \u2014 winter in Sapporo, summer in Tokyo \u2014 and Avery Brundage, then an IOC memberfrom the United States, aimed to keep the Games in Japan, despite [Brundage] said, only ifthe host city voluntarily gives it up. This is exactly what the Japanese Cabinet did on 16 July 1938, announc- ing to the world that eethe Olympic Games in their country would weaken \u2018the essential Japanese spirit.\u2019\u201d Butthe IOC had a backup plan after the Japanese gave up the Games.In the spring of 1939, it decidedto hold the 1940 Summer Games in Helsinki and the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, the German town that played hostto the 1936 Olympics. ose who were determined to games, come what may, were soon faced with another obstacle,\u201d wrote Allen Guttmann in The Olympics. \u201cOn Sept. 1, 1939, less than a year before the games ofthe 12th Olympiad were to be celebrated, Germany invaded Poland. While Brundage admitted that World War II was \u2018the suicide ofa culture,\u2019 he nonetheless clung to the illusion that the games might be saved... . \u201cThe definitive end to these illusory hopes came when Germany withdrewits invitation to host the winter games at Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the Soviet Union invaded Finland[on Nov.30].\u201d So, the Olympic Games do nottrumpwar, but they have survived acts of terrorism before. Twice during the Summer Games,in 1972 and 1996, people were killed in terrorist acts, and the Games continued.In 1972 in Munich, 11 Israelis were killed by Palestinian terrorists, but declared that the Games must go on. Andin 1996 in Atlanta, a bombexploded in Centennial Olympic Pere killing one person; the Games continNia just two days before the Atlanta Games opened, TWAFlight800 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean after takeofffrom New York, killing 230 people. The early speculation of a bomb exploding on board or a missile shooting it down \u2014 noabsolute conclusion was reached \u2014 bred suspicion ofterrorist involvement, but the Olympics were unaffected. IfTuesday\u2019s attacks are viewed over the nextfive months as a single act ofterrorism, albeit of unconscionable scale, then the brave words Tuesday ofthe 2002 Olympics proceeding unimp\u00e9ded will probably hold true.

Three years after Shepard\u2019s slaying captured international attention and drew condemnation from a slew of personalities, ranging from Madonna to then-President Clinton, those who were caught up in the case wonder what, if anything, has changed for gay peopleliving in the nation\u2019s ninth largest state geographically and. its least populated, with just 490,000 people.It is a question more on their minds than usual given the slaying in June of another young gay man, 16-year-old Fred Martinez Jr., whose battered body wasfound in neighboring Colorado on June21. \u201cI see Fred\u2019s death ... .asa clear sign that there is much moreto be done before we can live free from fear and hate,\u201d Shepard\u2019s mether, Judy,. said last month during a week of. vigils in memory of Martinez. The samegay activists and organizations that streamed into Laramie after Shepard\u2019s murder have also-been in Cortez, Colo., following the case and pressuring police to declare it a hate crime. A former Cortez resident, Shaun Murphy, 18, was charged with the murder of Martinez, an openly gay memberof the Navajotribe whodressed asa girl frequently and called himself \u201ctwo-spirit,\u201d an American Indian term for a i b e e OFF NULayy gays, lesbians, cross-dressers and transgendered. Cortez is about 500 miles from Laramie,but the similarities to the Shepard crime are striking. Both occurred in remote, tranquil towns in rug- gedly beautiful states that boast wide open spaces and claim to offer easygoing, \u201clive-and-letlive\u201d attitudes. Both victims were young, openly gay men beaten savagely, allegedly by young white men from the ht OSs Ta aa same area as their victims. Both were left to die in. open fields no more than a half-mile from the nearest homes buttoo far to be seen or heard by anyone.

Downey, afterall, was raised by her father alone and knew all about single parenting from both sides. Love is the thread that holds families together, says Downey,notthe presence of a certain numberof men, women and children. But that turned outto be a difficult concept for young Reilly Marie. to understand. When Downey's searchfor a children\u2019s book turned up nothing, she wrote one herself. Love is @ Family, with folksy illustra: she wantsa \u201creal family,\u201d more than just the two of them, Her mother, who bears a striking resemblance to Downey,sets out to remind Lily that families come in all forms.

For our Break the Fast, Rubell replaces the customary sour cream topping for the blintzes with fresh berry compote. Tuna salad with gobs of mayo is a staple on many Break the Fast buffets. Rubell invented the savory Chinese Seared Ahi Tuna Salad. Instead of the traditional sweet, heavy kugel, he will serve a vegetablefrittata.
